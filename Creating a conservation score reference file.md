# Creating a reference file for computing load scores from pre-computed conservation scores

Short overview of how to take pre-computed phyloP and phastcons scores from UCSC and use these to compute load scores for the species of interest.

## Step 1: Retrieving scores from UCSC

Pre-computed conservation scores are available from the UCSC website for different subsets of species (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/). 
The following will use the placental mammal subset of phastcons and phyloP scores from the 46-way vertebrate alignment:
